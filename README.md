# Student Progress Tracker

## Project Title
Student Progress Tracker

## Overview of the Project
Student Progress Tracker is a simple Python console application that helps track a student's marks across multiple tests and subjects. It focuses not only on calculating averages and grades but also on checking whether the student’s performance is improving, declining, or staying the same over time. This makes it more insightful than a single-exam grade calculator and connects directly with real-world academic progress tracking.

## Features
- Accepts basic student details (name, ID).
- Records marks for multiple tests in multiple subjects.
- Calculates per-subject averages and overall average.
- Determines performance trend for each subject (Improved / Declined / Same / Mixed).
- Assigns an overall grade based on the final average.
- Displays a neat text-based progress report for the student.

## Technologies / Tools Used
- Programming Language: Python 3.x
- Environment: Any Python-capable IDE or terminal (VS Code, PyCharm, IDLE, or command-line)
- Standard input/output for user interaction
